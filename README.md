detect yawning &amp; eye drowsiness(using EAR method) from live video to wake the sleepy person ,this APP built on Surabhi Kumaris paper 
<br/>

built based on this paper(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-4866-0_28) It is a real-time system which will detect the drowsiness among car drivers by capturing image continuously and will warn the driver whenever they will feel sleepy.
<br/>
The innovation of the present work is established on blinking of eyes and yawn frequency.

The per closure value of eye is examined for detection of drowsiness, and whenever it exceeds a certain value, then the driver is recognized to be sleepy. Similarly, we will inspect the yawn value to detect the drowsiness and whenever it exceeds its minimum threshold value it will give yawn alert.
